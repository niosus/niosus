- ðŸ¤– I am mostly interested in perception/localization/SLAM in anything related to robotics. You can see this by following my pinned repos and the carreer path on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-bogoslavskyi/). I have a PhD in robotics from the university of Bonn, from the [Cyrill Stachniss'](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/cyrill-stachniss/) lab and I've published and presented at various robotics conferences like ICRA, IROS, RosCon etc.
- ðŸ’» I am also fond of C++, I've talked at CppCon and am maintaining [EasyClangComplete](https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete) - a Sublime Text 3/4 plugin for C++ code completion. Please donate something or sponsor me on GitHub if you find this effort useful!
